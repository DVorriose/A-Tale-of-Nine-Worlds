# A-Tale-of-Nine-Worlds
A Minecraft v1.12.2 modpack to bring together multiple play-styles; a kitchen pack with more than just a sink.



1. TLDR:  Different types of mods to bring together different types of players; play with family, friends, and random strangers with different likes. Includes:
	- Deliberately Omitted Mods:  Some purposfully left out!
	- Beauty & Exploration.
	- Survival, Adventure, & Creative gameplay, combined.
	- RPG: PvE alongside both PvP AND Towny.
	- Loose progression mixed with Sandbox gameplay.
	- Challenging: Semi-Hardcore, but not overly tedious.
	- Magic, Tech, & Magi-Tech.
	- Tons of Building & Deco.
 

2. RULES:  Before we go any further, lets break one:  

SERVER OWNERS - CHANGE THIS PACK! Just:
	- Credit modders.
	- Respect EULAs.
	- NO PAYWALLS!  (Server maintenence OK)
	- Link here as original pack.
	- BE CAREFUL!  Many mods are integrated.

WARNING 1: This pack is in BETA.  The mods are (mostly) stable, but some configurations will change.  Some items are missing recipies.  Custom content isn't yet created.
WARNING 2: This pack is heavy; recommend at least 4-5GB, and some server room for saves.
WARNING 3: This pack is very close to the ID limit, and not compatible with JustEnoughIDs.


3. Design:  
	- Deliberate Omissions: 
		* No JourneyMap!  It destroys immersion!  Turn blind corners, make secret rooms and passageways, build waypoints, and use in-game tools to find your way.  
		* No WAILA.  It destroys immersion!  Is that lever/book/carpet really a secret door?  Is it trapped?  Is it yours?
		* No Tinkers' Construct!  Have a reason to use all those other great mods' tools.
		* No Chisel.  IDs used for other building blocks; make something new.
		* No AE2.  Some automation provided, but otherwise, make better mousetraps.
		
	- Beauty & Exploration: Several rich and immersive worlds filled with their own life (and death), beauty, and ambience.  Found a settlement or make a tent and live on the road.
	
	- Survival/Adventure/Creative:  
		* Structure and NPC tools for creative players to make new content for survival and adventure players
		* Reset dimensions of your choice, manually and on a timer; auto-spawn your content on world resets. 
		* Hold build (& NPC!) contests, and integrate the winners's designs (or your staff's creations), onto your server.

	- RPG: 
		* Towny: Stay safe in your claim, whether a player/NPC settlement or in the wild. Trade for resources from distant lands. Emote in your choosen character model. Lots of deco/furniture, clothing, pets, crops, and immersive cooking.
		* Adventure/PvE: [[CONTENT UNDER CONSTRUCTION, not yet in game]]  Modded and custom dungeons, temples, and monuments to raid, but also mob & NPC encampments, forts, and bases. Raid in a group and revive (and be revived by) your friends.  Lots of (expandable, resetable) content to explore, even if you don't go to space.
		* PvP: Nametags are (mostly) hidden. Start with swords, progress to magic and tech, and end with starships and megalasers. By default, PvP is enabled at night, outside of claimed areas.  Configurable times and dims for server admins.
		
	- Loose Progression: You can "complete" the pack with just 5 mods, but you can skip most progression if you choose....
		* A lengthened and immersive early-game through PrimalCore (and Kitsu's Forgecraft), less tedious than TFC.
		* A lengthened and immersive mid-game through the Heat and Climate, including in-world cooking and smelting.
		* A lengthened and immersive end game through space and magic interplanetary exploration.
		* A long after-game through WarpDrive and ComputerCraft, for anyone who wants to stick around and abuse all the industry they created.
		* NOT FORCED!  Trade, raid, and quickly build your own SteamPunk, EmberPunk, ThaumPunk, or BotaniPunk WarpShip.
		* OR!  Live in and enjoy living an expansive overworld without progressing.
		
	- Challenging:
		* No log punching.
		* Disabled (but craftable) furnaces.
		* Wood and stone tool recipies disabled.
		* Modded ores generate in large, rare clumps, differeing by biome type; overcome these limits through mods, trade, or exploration.
		* Food matters.  Digging deep is hard work, as is flying; you'll want something better than Baked Potatoes.
		* Long days for work and exploration make for long, dark nights.
		* Mobs are a little trickier, faster, and more tenatious, but (most) aren't overpowered.  Different dimensions present different mobs with different challenges.  You're (mostly) safe inside, even away from home.
			-> Vandalizing villages is NOT recommended.
		* Challenging but rewarding free-form "multi-block" in-world smelting mechanics.
		* Rockets are big, and Advanced Rocketry warp is slow.  There are no tesseracts; each off-world ship/station/base will need its own utilities.
		* Interdimensional teleportation, item, and energy transfer is difficult.
		* RFTools Force Fields, block protectors, and teleportation are prohibitively energy intensive, and make great late-game energy dumps.
	
	- Magic, Tech, & Magi-Tech: Each major culture has its own "technology;" some help progression, others just give a leg-up or entertain.
	
	- Building & Deco: 
		* Lots of beautiful biomes (your canvas).  Underwater building is easier, and worthwhile: no-waterfall glass with backdrop of plants, coral, and fish!  
		* Lots of tools, from Little Tiles to Effortless Building.
		* Lots of furniture, from several mods medievil to modern; or make your own.
